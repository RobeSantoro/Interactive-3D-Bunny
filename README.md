It can move the head around following the mouse.
If you write in the field of form, the bunny will move the eyes to the direction you wrote.

Inspired by the talk by [Luigi Rosso and Guido Rosso @ Flutter Interact '19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QZy5sYozVI&t)

It could enhance the login experience if I put more effort on it.
